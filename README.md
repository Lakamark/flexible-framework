Welcome to the official repository of my own PHP Framework. The repository is only the framework not a full web app.
This is a demo of my own framework. When I decide to release an official version of this framework, I will make a 
new GitHub repository with only the framework structure. In the future, I will create a blank project with the 
framework and add some pre-installation libraries. 

## The origin of the project
The origin of the project from a great French developer.
He creates a tutorial series about how to create a framework to
use POO in PHP. The title of the series is [Mise en pratique de la POO en PHP
](https://grafikart.fr/formations/mise-pratique-poo). The problem is developed in the PHP 7x version. I am using PHP.
8.x version. You know what is mean...

## Challenge!
My challenge is applying the
theory in the courses with a recent PHP version.
It is totally normal if you compare the code in the video with my code
in this repository, there are a lot of differences.
The classes used in the series are changed a lot.
Some libraries watched in the video are abandoned.
I should find some alternatives or to develop my own feature. The theory of the courses is still up to date.

## Why do you want to create your own framework?
It is a good question. Let me explain the reason:

They are some good PHP frameworks already exist (Symfony, Laravel CakePHP etc.)
1. First, I want to improve my PHP.
2. I am looking at some challenges.
3. The big frameworks have their own pattern (MVC) Model-Controller-View.
   It is perfect if you stay in the frame.
4. I need to outbound the framework frame to attempt my golds. I have a specific vision of my project. I
   think developing my own framework for my own purpose is easier to have control.

## What will happen with the project lakamark.com
I'm working on my website [lakamark.com](https://github.com/Lakamark/Lakamark.com) with the Symfony framework. I
like this framework. I'm more comfortable with the Symfony framework rather than the Laravel framework. Another
world, it based on my personal choice. My official website is developed on Symfony because it is safer. Also, they are a
huge community to help me. Don't worry is not tomorrow I will pass my website from Symfony to this framework. This
framework is not ready, they are a lot to do. Actually, it is an experimental project.

## Open Source
The project is open source. Everyone can clone the repository to help me to grow up the framework. If you have some
ideals to implement new fixtures, you can open to issues. I do my best to respect the standard code. You can command
the section code and classes to explain why it is not in the standard code. I am open to any tips to improve my skills.
